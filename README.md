# N-Labs-P-PC-s

Welcome to **N-Labs-P-PC-s**, a project that explores the concepts of Linked Lists, Backtracking, and OOP principles in Data Structures.

## Overview

This project was built as a hands-on application after learning about:
- **Linked Lists** – for efficient data management and node traversal.
- **Backtracking** – to explore different solution paths.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – for organizing and structuring code.

To some extent, this project structure resembles graphs, integrating multiple data structure techniques. This project serves as a great example of implementing complex data connections and backtracking solutions, resembling a graph-like structure.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation with Linked Lists**: Effective node management and traversal.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Demonstrates solving problems by exploring multiple possibilities.
- **Graph-Like Structure**: Simulates graph-related connections through the use of Linked Lists and Backtracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Linked Lists**
- **Backtracking**
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
